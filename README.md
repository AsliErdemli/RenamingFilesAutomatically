# RenamingFilesAutomatically

This function is to automatically name some files (The renaming could be 
sequential or randomized, depending on your preference).
The directories of the files to rename should be put in the folder 
containing this script. If files to rename are not in a directory, it is
advised to do so. 

Add Stimuli in directories under the directory containing this script. 

newNamePrefix == should be a char of what needs to be the fixed part of
the newname. Ex: If we want MyNewImageName_1.png, MyNewImageName_2.png, 
MyNewImageName_3.png,  We should set newnameprefix as 'MyNewImageName_'
